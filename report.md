You can compile and run this by running the included `run.sh` script.

I produced the programs by improving and modifying my lab 7 code.

I found the obj files by googling around for various obj models.

I didn't manage to find a way to get a marble-looking texture ( all the examples online didn't look at all like marble), but the wood-like texture I came up with is ok. I started working on trying to add a bumpiness effect, but it was taking too long.
